3D visualization for queries using Java Multimedia Retrieval

Due to the advancement of technology, more and more devices have the ability to capture images. This has caused a significant increase in image databases, which has led to a significant increase in image databases, which in turn has led to the emergence of methodologies to solve the problem of handling, management and retrieval of such information. In this case when we talk about methodology we refer to the information retrieval systems, based primarily on low-level descriptors (color, texture, etc.) obtained directly from the image.These systems are called CBIR.

The aim of this project is to develop modules to display the information obtained by using information retrieval systems, specifically Java Multimedia RetrievalÂ©. The environment in which information is represented is a three-dimensional environment in which the user can move freely through it, modify certain parameters to improve the experience and get data on what is shown in that environment.

The main advantage of these modules over others is the use of a three-dimensional environment. Most CBIR use two-dimensional views which can be problematic if you want to see the result of the query using various descriptors. This project has visualizations that only require a single descriptor, but can be used with more than one, and others that require various descriptors to function properly.

For the development of the different modules has been used Java 3D. It is an API used for creating 3D graphics using the Java programming language.
